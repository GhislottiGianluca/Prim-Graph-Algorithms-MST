## Project Target
The aim of this project is to implement **Prim's algorithm** for the solution of the MST problem for non-directed and connected graphs with non-negative weights.

The implementation of this algorithm was based on the production and use of the data structure: **MinHeap** (MinPriorityQueue).

The algorithm has been solved in both languages.
